    <h1>Other Writing</h1>
    <p>
      For other writing, I wanted to showcase a paper I wrote for a computing ethics class that I took at Ohio State. It is about the ethicality
      of Facebook implementing behavioral techniques in its apps.
    </p>
    <h2>Facebook's Usage of Behavioral Techniques</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Facebook employs various behavioral techniques to keep users engaged. Behavioral techniques in social media refer to the
      use of psychological tactics to grab user attention. These include notifications, infinite scroll, the color red for the
      notification icon, and variable rewards. Infinite scroll, for instance, can lead users to consume content unnecessarily
      as it eliminates natural stopping points and gives users no reason to pause or exit. Swipe down to refresh can resemble
      a slot machine, as users are uncertain whether they will receive a "reward" of new posts or not. Tristan Harris, a
      former design ethicist at Google, has raised concerns about the ethics of using psychological tactics to influence user
      behavior and increase engagement on social media platforms. He has highlighted how ethical design is being trumped by
      the quest for profit and how tech companies will do whatever they need to maximize user attention.1 This is worrisome as
      some users are unaware of these techniques being used to exploit and negatively impact them. It is imperative to
      question the morality of Facebook’s deceptive use of behavioral techniques, given the platform’s immense size and
      influence.
    </p>
    <h3>The Argument</h3>
    <p>
      Assuming the humanity formulation of Kantianism is true, Facebook’s use of behavioral techniques is morally
      impermissible.<br><br>

      [P1] Facebook’s underlying maxim for implementing behavioral techniques treats users as a mere means without their
      informed consent.<br><br>

      [P2] If Facebook’s underlying maxim treats users as a mere means without their informed consent then Facebook’s use of
      behavioral techniques is morally impermissible.<br><br>

      [C1] Therefore, it is morally impermissible for Facebook to use behavioral techniques.<br><br>

      P2 is directly shown to be true by the humanity formulation of Kantianism. This is because if rational and autonomous
      beings (the users) are treated as a means without their informed consent, then the action (implementing behavioral
      techniques) is morally impermissible. Kantianism is an especially natural choice for this argument as behavioral
      techniques are often hidden and covert. The techniques are not clearly communicated to users when signing up.<br><br>

      It is then sufficient to justify P1 to show that the conclusion is true.<br><br>

      Normally, to argue an action is morally permissible according to the humanity formulation of Kantianism, one must first
      describe an action's maxim. A maxim is a self-imposed principle that outlines the "what" and "why" of an action that one
      is about to take. Facebook is a privately owned company whose main objective is to maximize profits and increase
      shareholder value. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Facebook's maxim is to maximize profits by implementing
      behavioral techniques that increase user engagement. This underlying maxim treats users as a means as Facebook is
      generating revenue off of its users.<br><br>

      Next, it is necessary to list all rational and autonomous beings used as a means and show they provided informed
      consent. This would be necessary to show an action is permissible.<br><br>

      In this argument, however, I am trying to show an action is impermissible. I just need to show that one user used as a
      means did not provide informed consent. This can be accomplished by showing that Facebook users did not provide informed
      consent when signing up for the platform to Facebook’s implementation of behavioral techniques. That is what I will
      demonstrate in the next section of this argument.
    </p>
    <h3>Behavioral Techniques</h3>
    <p>
      Behavioral techniques in social media are software features that hijack psychological vulnerabilities. Tristan Harris
      mentions some used in social media like social approval using likes and image tagging, autoplay to prevent users from
      pausing, infinite feeds, and more.<br><br>

      The moral concern is that Facebook implements these techniques without user awareness. To demonstrate this, I will
      explain the sign up process of creating a Facebook account below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to facebook.com</li>
      <li>Click “Create new account”</li>
      <li>A “Sign Up” pane opens where you fill in your first name, last name, mobile number or email, new password, birthday and
      gender.</li>
      <li>Click “Sign Up”</li>
      <li>Verify email address or phone number</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The “Create new account” pane is the only part of the sign up process that could contain information about behavioral
      techniques. At the bottom of the pane, there are small links for the Terms and Service, Privacy Policy, and Cookies
      Policy.<br><br>

      The first page I will review is the Terms of Service page. There is information discussing what Meta is and how Facebook
      has recently updated their name to Meta.3 The page has four sections. The first section discusses the services they
      provide. The second section discusses how these services are funded. The third section discusses who can use Facebook,
      what can you do on Meta products, permissions Meta needs from users to provide their services, and intellectual
      property. The permissions include the ability to use content that users create and share, to use a user’s name with ads
      and sponsored content, and to update software that users download. The final section has information about updating the
      terms, account suspension and termination, liability, disputes, and some others. The only technique mentioned is
      advertisements which influence user behavior but it is only a reference to one technique being used.<br><br>

      The next page I will review is the privacy policy page. The privacy policy contains tables, videos, and links to other
      pages.4 It mentions how Meta collects a variety of data about its users, including: activity (posts, comments, audio),
      messages, purchases, and hashtags, device information, friends, followers, other connections, and information from their
      partners and third parties. The page goes on to explain how Facebook uses this information to provide a personalized
      experience, advertisements, and recommendations. This is a direct reference to behavioral techniques as they are using
      artificial intelligence for content recommendation to addict users. The page links to another page titled “What are
      recommendations on Facebook?”, which discusses how and why Facebook makes recommendations. They state their goal with
      recommendations is to help users discover new communities and content. Nothing refers to user engagement. Despite
      mentioning a single behavioral technique, I do not think this suffices as providing adequate information as Facebook’s
      intentions of recommendations are not as simple as helping users discover new content. Secondly, mentioning a single
      behavioral technique is not sufficient in fully informing the user of all techniques.<br><br>

      The rest of the privacy policy page contains information about how they share information to other Meta products and
      their Integrated partners, which is not relevant to this paper as it is not about behavioral techniques implemented in
      Facebook.<br><br>

      The last page that I will review is the Cookies Policy, which is relatively brief and does not make any mention of
      behavioral techniques.5 This page would be difficult to understand without a technical background as it discusses
      authentication, security, performance, and other aspects of cookies.<br><br>

      Overall, the sign up process does not provide information about all behavioral techniques Facebook employees. As a
      result, the sign up process doesn’t allow new users to provide informed consent as they are unaware of all techniques
      implemented to keep them addicted to Facebook. Even if references to these features were nested deep in the pages, it is
      still not guaranteeing the users’ informed consent because users do not have to look at the pages to create an account.
      According to the Pew Research Center, around 22 percent of Americans always or often read privacy policies before
      agreeing to them.6 And only 22 percent of this group reads the policies all the way through. Thus, policy pages are not
      an effective way of guaranteeing informed consent.<br><br>

      The Facebook sign up pane has the links for the Terms, Privacy Policy, and Cookies policy in small text at the bottom,
      making it hard for users to get to the pages. Right below the links is a large, green “Sign Up” button that would take
      the user’s attention away from the page links. In order to guarantee informed consent, Facebook would have to have a
      “Behavioral Techniques Overview '' pane that contained information regarding all techniques they use and why they are
      effective in increasing user engagement. There could be statistics informing users on how certain techniques increase
      user engagement. But the way the Sign Up page currently is, there is little information on these techniques and the
      information isn’t displayed clearly. In addition, expecting users to read through thousands of words of technical and
      business jargon is not a realistic expectation for a sign up process that is supposed to be “quick and easy”, as
      mentioned on the “Sign Up” pane.<br><br>

      One may object by claiming that users implicitly consent to these behavioral techniques when signing up for Facebook.
      They would mention many people are aware that social media is designed to addict users, therefore being informed of what
      they are consenting to. The problem with this is that some users will still be unaware of social media in general and
      its business model when first signing up. Few potential users will be aware of all techniques being used to keep them
      addicted. Many may know of some. And some users will be completely unaware. Consent should be explicit and clear, which
      is not the case with Facebook.<br><br>

      An objector could then say that if I implemented my “Behavioral Techniques Overview” pane, there could be individuals
      that quickly skim over the content without fully understanding it. This would be similar to how people often do not read
      Terms and Conditions clauses. In that case, the informed consent of the potential user was never guaranteed. I would say
      if the user is purposely trying to divert being informed regarding what they are consenting to, they are consenting to
      whatever the information says. If I pop up a pane that is clear and concise, and the user intentionally skims over it,
      then I would say they are consenting to the information. My proposal differs from the current implementation of the
      policy pages in that my pane would be mandatory and presented as a clear and concise step in the signup process. On the
      other hand, the policy pages are only accessible through small text links and are not required to be reviewed to
      complete the signup process.<br><br>

      I am using Kantianism as these features are not being clearly communicated to the user, violating their informed
      consent.<br><br>

      I am appealing to the humanity formulation of Kantianism as I am showing that new users of Facebook are not providing
      informed consent. Facebook’s underlying maxim is to maximize revenue by implementing behavioral techniques. But in doing
      so, it treats users merely as a means without informed consent. Therefore, acting on the maxim is not good and
      impermissible. This means that it is impermissible for Facebook to continue to use behavioral techniques.
    </p>
    <h3>Objections</h3>
    <p>
      An objector could say that users are aware of the techniques Facebook uses to keep them addicted, objecting to Premise
      1. They could claim that users are providing informed consent. Many users of social media have high screen time usage
      and understand that techniques are being used to keep them addicted. Objectors could mention that you can turn off some
      behavioral techniques like notifications. In other words, the user knows these features are by default “opt out” instead
      of “opt in”. In both iOS and Google Chrome, a user has to accept notification permissions before being sent them. This
      argument, however, is invalid as not all users are aware of all techniques. A user will not be able to “opt out” of
      certain techniques if they are not aware of them to begin. Yes, they are explicitly prompted for certain techniques like
      notifications but not for others like infinite scroll and social comparison. Many users may be aware of some techniques
      like notifications and recommendation algorithms but are often not familiar with all. For instance, I was unaware that
      the color blue was initially used for the notification icon in Facebook but then changed to red to maximize user
      engagement. There may be some users that are aware of all or most of these techniques but this is not relevant as some
      users are still unaware.<br><br>

      An objector could respond to my refutation by saying by my logic, every policy a company implements to increase revenue
      has to be communicated to the customers. For instance, I mentioned the color red before being used in Facebook. Red is
      also used in food logos as it triggers stimulation, hunger, and attention. And with my argument, these policies would
      have to be communicated to customers otherwise it would be impermissible for these companies to implement these schemes.
      My response is yes, anything a company does to generate more money without informing the customer would be
      impermissible. The problem still remains of the company treating the customer as a means without their informed consent
      so all the cases mentioned above would also apply the same way as Facebook.<br><br>

      Another potential objection is that providing users with all information regarding behavioral techniques would be
      overwhelming and unrealistic. This would be targeting premise 1 by claiming that providing informed consent would be
      impossible. Terms & Service Conditions are long and users often do not have the time to read through them (The Terms and
      Conditions for Facebook is roughly 5000 words long which would take the average reader 17 minutes to read). An objector
      could mention how a patient undergoing a surgery cannot understand exactly what is going to be performed on him but
      still provides consent. In a similar fashion, it could be argued that users of Facebook wouldn’t be able to understand
      all behavioral design techniques. Some users may be unaware of technologies like artificial intelligence and how it can
      provide recommendations. This is true but the issue of users being unaware still remains. Facebook would have to have
      ways of educating users of the techniques they use. A surgeon does his best job explaining the surgical process in
      simple and understandable language. Facebook provides next to no information about behavioral techniques. If it is
      impossible to provide informed consent, then by default, premise 1 is true. This is because the first part of premise 1,
      “Facebook’s underlying maxim for implementing behavioral techniques treats users as a mere means”, is true as I have
      established before and the second part, “without their informed consent”, is true as the objector would claim it is
      impossible to provide informed consent.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Assuming premise 1, Facebook’s underlying maxim for implementing behavioral techniques treats users as a mere means
      without their informed consent. Then assuming premise 2, Facebook’s use of behavioral techniques is morally
      impermissible.
