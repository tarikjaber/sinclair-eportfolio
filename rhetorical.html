    <h2 class="title">Rhetorical Analysis of 'Hurt' by Johnny Cash and Trent Reznor</h2>
    <p>
      The song "Hurt" was originally sung by Trent Reznor but was later adopted by Johnny
      Cash. Despite having the same lyrics, the different tones used in the two versions convey
      different meanings. Moreover, the way the songs are presented, including their imagery and
      environment, also has an impact on the interpretation of the song. Both versions explore themes
      of emotional pain and regret, but Cash's rendition targets an older audience by employing pathos
      and nostalgia, while Nine Inch Nails' original version appeals to a younger audience by utilizing
      ethos and raw emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trent Reznor is a highly influential American musician and songwriter who gained fame
      as the frontman of Nine Inch Nails, one of the most important industrial rock bands of the 1990s.
      In 1995, Reznor released "Hurt" as a promotional single for the album "The Downward Spiral,"
      which quickly became a fan favorite. The song was deeply personal for Reznor, who wrote it
      during a time of great personal turmoil when he was struggling with depression and drug
      addiction. In 2002, the legendary country singer Johnny Cash covered "Hurt" and released it on
      his album "American IV: The Man Comes Around." Cash's version of the song was a critical and
      commercial success, and it quickly became one of the most iconic covers of all time. Cash's
      rendition of "Hurt" also dealt with themes of addiction and regret, but it took on a different
      meaning due to the context of Cash's own life and career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Cash's rendition of "Hurt" not only appeals to an older audience through nostalgia
      but also through its use of pathos. By the time Cash recorded the song in 2002, he was already a
      legend in the music industry and had endured a lifetime of trials and tribulations. The lines in the
      song that reference his career and regrets add a layer of emotional depth that resonates with older
      listeners who may have experienced similar struggles in their lives. Moreover, the use of black
      and white imagery in the music video harkens back to an earlier era, evoking a sense of
      wistfulness that is often associated with nostalgia. Reznor's version of the song, on the other
      hand, taps into the raw emotion of his younger fanbase. The intensity of the lyrics and the raw
      power of his voice convey a sense of desperation and despair that many younger listeners can
      relate to. As a rock artist, Reznor was already appealing to a younger audience who were drawn
      to the genre's rebellious spirit and anti-establishment ethos. In summary, while both versions of
      "Hurt" tell a story of emotional pain and regret, they do so in ways that resonate differently with
      different age groups. Cash's version appeals to older listeners through nostalgia and pathos, while
      Reznor's version speaks to a younger audience through raw emotion and the rebellious spirit of
      rock music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of ethos and pathos in Johnny Cash's and Trent Reznor's versions of "Hurt" plays
      a critical role in influencing the overall message of the song. Johnny Cash heavily relied on ethos
      to convey his message. He appealed to his reputation and past accomplishments to establish
      credibility and authority with the listener. The use of imagery from his past and references to his
      career and wealth created a sense of nostalgia that appealed to older listeners who were more
      likely to have a rich history to reminisce upon. In addition, Cash's delivery of the lyrics in a deep,
      somber tone added to his credibility, as his voice had a sense of maturity and experience that
      further emphasized the sense of nostalgia and regret in the song. On the other hand, Trent
      Reznor's version relied primarily on pathos to convey its message. The emotional language and
      vocal range used in the song were designed to create a raw, intense emotional response in the
      listener. Reznor's version lacked the imagery found in Cash's, leaving the listener to focus solely
      on the lyrics and the emotions behind them. This emotional appeal made the song more relatable
      to younger listeners who were more likely to be going through similar issues related to
      depression and drug usage. Reznor's use of pathos added an element of authenticity to the song
      that made it more powerful and impactful to listeners who were struggling with similar issues.
      Despite having nearly identical lyrics, the use of different rhetorical appeals in the two versions
      provides different messages. Cash's version is more about nostalgia and regret, while Reznor's
      version is more about depression and pain. The contrast in the use of ethos and pathos between
      the two versions also highlights the differences in the intended audience for each version. The
      different rhetorical appeals in each version ultimately contribute to the unique emotional impact
      of each rendition of the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite both songs having similar lyrics, Johnny Cash’s adoption of Trent Reznor’s Hurt
      appeals to a different audience and showcases a different message. Cash’s usage of imagery and
      singing style depict regret and nostalgia. Reznor’s emotional style conveys more emotion and
      focuses more on drug usage and depression.
